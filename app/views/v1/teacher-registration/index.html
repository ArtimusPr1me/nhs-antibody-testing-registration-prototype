      <p class="govuk-body">Ask for a home fingerprick blood test to help support an NHS research project. The NHS wants to understand who has had the virus before, and how it is spreading in the UK.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the test</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies. If you have them, it's likely you've had the virus before.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The test cannot tell you when you had it or how effective your antibodies are.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you've had the virus before, you must still follow the same rules as everyone else to lower the risk of catching it again and spreading it.</p>
