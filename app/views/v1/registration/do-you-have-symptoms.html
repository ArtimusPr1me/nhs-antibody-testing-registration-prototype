      <p class="govuk-body-m">This will help us track and trace the spread of coronavirus.</p>

      <p>The main symptoms of coronavirus are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>high temperature</strong> – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)</li>
        <li><strong>new, continuous cough</strong> – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)</li>
        <li><strong>loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</strong> – this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">Most people with coronavirus have at least one of these symptoms.</p>
