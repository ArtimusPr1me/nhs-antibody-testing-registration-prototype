      <p class="govuk-body-l">You may be able to take part in a national research study into coronavirus (COVID-19) if you're a teacher or teaching support staff. Use this service to check you're eligible and sign up to take part.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Aim of the antibody research</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The NHS and medical scientists need to learn more about who has already had the virus and how it is spreading in the UK at a national, regional and local level. Many people may have had mild symptoms or none at all.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Collecting this data will help the NHS and the UK plan its response to the spread of the virus.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Find out more about the research</a></p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What do you have to do to take part</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">To take part in the research you have to take a coronavirus antibody test. It's a fingerprick blood test that you do at home (it is sent to you in the post).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The home test kit is safe, accurate and easy to use. It comes with everything you need and simple step-by-step instructions. There's a video to help you.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You take the test and return your sample in the post. You'll get your results a few days later.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you want to know more, <a href="#">watch this video</a> and <a href="#">read more detail.</a></p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Antibody test</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies. If you have them, it is likely you've had the virus before.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This is not an immunity test. It cannot tell you when you had the virus or how effective (if at all) any antibodies are. COVID-19 is a new virus and doctors do not yet know if it is possible for you to catch it again or spread it.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Find out more about antibody testing</a> and what your result means.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can take part in the research</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can take part in the research study if:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you're a teacher or teaching support staff</li>
        <li>you've got a mobile phone</li>
        <li>you're aged 18 or over</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">It does not matter if you've had the virus before or not.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How take part in the research study</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are 4 steps.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 1</strong> - check you're comfortable doing a fingerprick test</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 2</strong> - sign up to take part in the research<br>
        You'll be asked a few quick questions to check you're eligible and for some basic information about you, like your contact details, gender, and if you've had the virus before.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 3</strong> - wait to be invited to order a test<br>
        You'll get a text inviting you to order a test kit and take part in the research. It may not happen straight away.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 4</strong> - take the test<br>
        Take the test at home following the step by step instructions. You'll be emailed a copy of your results.</p>
